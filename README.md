Ruby Cal Program
================

This is a Ruby project for the Nashville Software School. The goal is to create a Ruby program that mimics the 
functionality of the command line program cal.

Phase 1
--

Created integration tests that will compare the final output of my program against cal.

Phase 2
--

Created unit tests to go along with the TDD mentality of this project.

Phase 3
--

Created methods that pass my unit tests and eventually reach the goal of cal like output.

Phase 4
--

Ran integration tests to compare the output to cal.

Phase 5
--

Currently refactoring code. Code has been refactored with possible future additions to the project in mind.



Eliza, please note that this output was made to pass compared to cal run in terminal on a Mac. I have tried these integration tests in Ubuntu and they have failed due to the fact that Ubuntu's version of cal adds trailing whitespaces to the end of every line including empty lines. Apple's cal has no trailing whitespaces and makes refactoring much easier.
